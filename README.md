# Ugli Launcher
UgliLauncher is a custom built Minecraft launcher to host various modpacks made by me. The launcher allows installing/launching custom modpacks while facilitating automatic modpack updating for a seamless multiplayer experience, along with having the ability to add patches and modify game config files on launch for personalized settings. It also features an automatic update functionality to the program so that users don't have to be burdened with constantly checking for updates themselves. It all just works! All modpacks are passed directly to the official Minecraft launcher, so this program will not ask for your login information. This launcher has been re-written multiple times, first existing with a CMD interface, then with a fancy GUI, then returning to the classic CMD interface (because lets be honest, the GUI required significantly more effort to update and maintain compared to a bat file).

EDIT: This image no longer represents the final product since reverting to the more simple CMD interface. Kept for historical purposes.
